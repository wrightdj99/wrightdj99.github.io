								<p> Hello everyone, my name is Dan Wright, and 
									this is my portfolio. I'm currently working towards a Master's Degree in
									Software Engineering at DePaul University, and have already completed my Bachelor's Degree in User Experience Development. Some of
									of my coding interests include Web and Mobile Application Development. In my day-to-day work, I primarily use Java, Python, and SQL for software engineering, and Figma as well as AdobeXD for UI design. To see what I have 
									accomplished so far, click here to view some of my <a href="#work">applications</a> or <a href="#deswork"> UI prototypes</a>.</p>

								<h2 id="csApplic" class="major">C# Applications</h2>
								<p><strong>Recently, I've begun learning C# (particularly the .NET framework) in concurrency with Java! These are the C# projects I've done thus far</strong></p>
								<hr>
								<a href="https://github.com/wrightdj99/NumberGuesser">Number Guessing Game</a>	
								<p>This is my first project written in C# using the .NET framework, the first of many more to come in the future. It's a simple terminal-based number guessing game that taught me the basic differences of C# and Visual Studio, compared to the world of Java and Intellij that I've grown so accustomed to. More projects will be coming very soon, but for now, check out the Readme in the Git repo for more information on running the project.</p>
								<hr>
								<a href="https://github.com/wrightdj99/ContactList">Phone Book in C#/.NET</a>
								<p>To get back in the coding spirit after a couple of days off over the holidays, I decided to learn a little bit more about WinForms. I love making GUI applications with JFrame in Java, so learning about WinForms in C# seemed like the next logical step. In this project, the user is able to enter a friend's first name, last name and phone number into the respective fields. From there, the new contact will be saved in the phone book via a text file in the project's directory.</p>
								<hr>
								<h2 id="jApplic" class="major">Java Applications</h2>
								<h3 id="jComplete" class="major"><strong>Completed Java Projects</strong></h3>
								<hr>
								<p><strong>Full-stack Maven projects that show off my Java/Swing programming skills.</strong></p>
								<hr>
								<a href="https://github.com/wrightdj99/AncientInstantMessagingProgram">Java Instant Messaging Server</a>
									 <p>Before I say anything else, I should note that this project goes with the Java Instant Messaging Client that's below. Anyway, this project is the server-side application for an instant messaging application I made over one weekend. With a front-end written in Java's Swing library, and a back-end that uses networking sockets and streams to communicate with a client, I was able to learn more about networking practices in programming that were introduced in a previous Systems Programming class I took at DePaul.</p>
								<a href="https://github.com/wrightdj99/AncientMessagingClient">Java Instant Messaging Client</a>
									 <p>This is the Java Instant Messaging Client application that goes with the Java Instant Messaging Server. When the Java Instant Messaging Server is started, the Java Instant Messaging Client can be started on your computer's localhost address to connect to the server. From there, a networking stream will start between the specified ports (must be the same, I believe I made it port 6788 in the application) between the Client and Server.</p>
									 <p>Within this "married pair" project of the Client and Server Instant Messaging Program, the one thing that I wish had gone differently was the ability to have this run on two different computers and not just on my own machine. That's definitely a work in progress with this project at the moment.</p>
								<a href="https://github.com/wrightdj99/Group13CleanSweep_SE_459">Roomba Simulation</a>
									<p>I'm really excited to show this one off! This is the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of a term-long group project that I worked on for an Agile Programming class at DePaul. It's a full-stack simulation of a Roomba robot that has been given a variety of names, Clean Sweep Robot by our professor, and "Jenny" towards the end of the term by my group and I (in reference to My Life As A Teenage Robot). </p>
									<p>In any case, the Clean Sweep Robot features a number of things. For one, it can traverse "floors" efficiently by using a greedy search algorithm (Djikstra's) to convert them into a two-dimensional linked list. Inside these linked lists, each node contains information about the floor type it is in the simulation, as well as whether or not the node in the linked list represents an obstacle for the Clean Sweep to navigate around. 
										In addition, this simulated Clean Sweep Robot can also detect when it's getting low on battery and will use our greedy search algorithm to return to its charging station at node (0, 0) in every linked list. </p>
									<p>Another thing that the Clean Sweep features is a user portal that is written in Swing. Through this user portal, owners of the Clean Sweep can create a user profile (this is always authenticated) that will be saved to a JSON file and will allow returning users to login with ease. Once users are logged in, they will be able to see the history of their Clean Sweep's floor traversal from the last session, as well as a more in-depth report on what it encountered with each part of the floor (each node in the list). 
										Finally, as a personal first: this project doesn't just contain source code on GitHub, there are also now JARS! These can be found in the linked repository inside the <strong>target</strong> folder. Look for <strong>main_to_jar.jar</strong> for the full project.</p>
								<a href="https://github.com/wrightdj99/danWrightPaint">Java Paint</a>
									<p>I remember working on this project like it was yesterday, it was my first "big boy" project in Java. This is an application with a front-end written in Swing and a back-end written in Java that acts as a geometric artboard, that I commonly call JPaint. In this application, the user can draw circles, triangles and ellipses of various colors and shades. They can also undo their drawings, redo them (put them back on the screen after deletion) and are able to move them around the screen. The great thing about working on this project was the fact that it has taught me about the agile development process, and how to approach a software challenge in a structured, and methodical
										manner through utilization of SOLID principles that keep code clean and efficient to produce a great end result.</p>
								<a href="https://github.com/wrightdj99/StarducksCoffeeShop">StarDucks Coffee Shop</a>
									<p>This is a weekend personal project that I worked on. It's a simulated coffee shop ordering app (similar in nature to the StarBUCKS app) that lets users choose a drink and a drink size to order. From this project, I learned to not only develop a small app using Swing, but more importantly how to develop something full-stack. This has not only a front-end UI that's written in Java's Swing library, but it also has a back-end component that calculates price as well.</p>
								<h3 id="dStruct"><strong>Work From Data Structures I and II</strong></h3>
								<hr>
								<p><strong>These are from my early days of programming that helped solidify the basics of programming (i.e. arrays, linked lists, loops, recursion, etc.).</strong></p>
								<hr>
								<a href="https://github.com/wrightdj99/javaGrades">Grading System</a>
									<p>Here is a personal project that I coded when I had a day off of classwork. It's a simple grading system where the user can enter in their ten assignments (or labs if we're trying to be relatable for my fellow CS majors) and the program averages their total score into a final letter grade.</p>		
								<a href="https://github.com/wrightdj99/fibonacci_moose">Mickey Moose Fibonacci</a>
									<p>This is another program that I wrote for a Data Structures I class at DePaul University. It contains recursive methods that manipulates lists in Java, as well as a program that draws Mickey Mouse as Mickey Moose! More specifically, through Java code this program can take a picture of Mickey Mouse and turn the mouse ears into moose antlers. NOTE: The user will need DePaul University's Algs4 Java folder to make this program run.</p>
										
								<a href="https://github.com/wrightdj99/dans_deque">Queues and Stacks in Java</a>
									<p>Here is an assignment that I did for my Data Structures I class at DePaul University. In a nutshell, this program moves between a right and left stack until both sides are balanced. NOTE: The user will need DePaul University's Algs4 Java folder to make this program run.</p>

								<h2 id="pythApp" class="major">Python Applications</h2>
								<hr>
								<p><strong>From my early days of programming in Python for Intro to Computer Science I and II</strong></p>
								<hr>
									<a href="https://github.com/wrightdj99/weatherapp">Weather App</a>
										<p>This is a weather application that I made using object-oriented Python. It retrieves data about current weather conditions in a location that the user enters from a weather API and then delivers the current weather conditions back to the user through a GUI interface.</p>
																			
									<a href="https://github.com/wrightdj99/python_clock">Python Clock</a>
										<p>Simply clock powered by Python, it was one of my first homework assignments for an Intro to Python class.</p>
								
									<a href="https://github.com/wrightdj99/seat_reservation">Seat Reservation Application</a>
                                						<p>Here, we have my first ever object-oriented Python script that I wrote! This is an application that mimics a seat reservation method on the website of a transit company like Greyhound Bus or Amtrak. Here, I learned all about dunder (magic) methods and how they can add extra structure to an application. In addition, I learned how efficient object-oriented programming can be when trying to make an application that is more streamlined. In other words, coding this application with an object-oriented framework made it more user-friendly by providing more features that would be harder to add into a simple input/output function.</p>

								<h2 id="sqlApp" class="major">SQL Database Work</h2>
								<hr>
								<p><strong>Some work from a SQL Databases class I took</strong></p>
								<hr>
								<a href="https://github.com/wrightdj99/IntroductorySQL">Introductory Database Work</a>
										<p>These two SQL files in this repository are from the first homework assignment I completed for a SQL class that I took at DePaul University in the Spring Quarter of 2021. To learn more about how relational databases work, I was given data from a furniture store and performed basic SQL operations to learn more about said furniture store and their clientele.</p>
								<a href="https://github.com/wrightdj99/RelationalSQL">Relational Database Series</a>
										<p>These three SQL files in this repository were all parts of a relational database assignment that I completed. The three files deal with relational databases with joins, as well as union and minus operators to effectively query data. I should also mention that the three files in this repository deal with a restaurant review database (Part-C.sql), an employee information system (Part-B.sql), and a travel agency database (Part-A.sql), respectively.</p>

									<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/gsYPo7BOhU9sonfF1fW96A/IntakeFormFinal---DosageSpecialistOffline?node-id=0%3A1">Equilibria Assistance Prototype</a>
										<p>This prototype was a quarter-long project for my UX Design Capstone class at DePaul in the final quarter term of my undergrad. This prototype was created for Equilibria, a women-founded and womens' health-centered CBD dispensary here in Chicago that helps its patrons manage health problems such as breast cancer, menopause and labor pains through field-to-dispensary CBD oil. My group and I were tasked with making a customer support page for the overall site that helps point customers towards dosage information, dosage consultations, and a few other things. In creating this prototype, I not only learned how to go through the UX Design process in an Agile environment, but I also often was tasked with leadership-based roles in this project, deciding how our team would work together to create an innovative end-result that put the end-user first.</p>
									<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/X9LsfXZ1NeFJqHu4CnOzCs/CSS-278-Life-University-Wireframe">Life University Prototype</a>
										<p>In the Autumn of 2020, I was tasked with creating the prototype of a Wordpress site for Life University for my Community Based Technology Project at DePaul University. Life University was created during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to help underprivileged people who had been hit hard by financial hardships by the ensuing recession learn new skills and side hustles that could help them get back up on their feet.</p>
									<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/QPbotA4JzVpYlZoiu9O0kQ/CDMPage?node-id=0%3A1">School Website Prototype</a>
										<p>This was a prototype that I made using Figma that simulates an improved version of my college's current website. The new version of the site allows users to browse example student work from a particular major, as well as take an online quiz that helps them decide which undergraduate major is right for them.</p>
								        <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/90NxSmtABuXe2sMCItjd8N/Jam-Store">Online Cooking Store</a>
								                <p>Here is one of the first prototypes that I created in a UI Development class at DePaul. It's a simple prototype of an online cooking store where you can buy fruit jam.</p>
